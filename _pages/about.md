I graduated from the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington in 2022. 

I am currently a research assistant at the [Noble Research Lab](https://noble.gs.washington.edu/). I work with [William Stafford Noble](https://noble.gs.washington.edu/~wnoble/) and [Yang Lu](https://younglululu.github.io/) on false discovery rate (FDR)-controlled machine learning methods for protein homology prediction and biological feature (e.g. transcription factors) interaction detection.

My research interests are:
1. Developing reliable ML methods for high-precision biomedical applications.
2. Error-controlled biological hypothesis generation with ML model interpretation.


I'm looking for PhD opportunities starting Fall 2023. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in learning more about me!
