I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at [UW ECE](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) studying Signal Processing. My research interest is developing trustworthy (intepretable & error-controlled) machine learning methods for biomedical applications.

I am part of the [Noble Research Lab](https://noble.gs.washington.edu/) and adviced by [William Stafford Noble](https://noble.gs.washington.edu/~wnoble/) and [Yang Lu](https://younglululu.github.io/)
