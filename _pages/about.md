I graduated from the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington in 2022. 

I am currently a research assistant at the [Noble Research Lab](https://noble.gs.washington.edu/) and working with [William Stafford Noble](https://noble.gs.washington.edu/~wnoble/) and [Yang Lu](https://younglululu.github.io/) on false discovery rate (FDR)-controlled machine learning methods for protein homology prediction and biological feature (e.g. transcription factors) interaction detection.

My research interest is building trustworthy (interpretable & error-controlled) machine learning methods for various biometical applications. 

I'm looking for PhD position starting Fall 2023. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in learning more about me!
